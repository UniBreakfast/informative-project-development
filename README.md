# [Informative Project Development](http://github.com/unibreakfast/informative-project-development)

## What is this?

It's a take at a project development process that is more informative. It's a set of guidelines that can be used to develop projects in a way that is more informative to the people who are working on the project, and to the people who are using the project.

## Where is information about project development?

- the code in the project files themselves
- the documentation written by the project authors and developers
- the feedback written by the project users with responses from the project developers
- the reports generated by the software tools to make the project development process more informative

## Recommendations that comes to mind

- some sort of requirements have to be written before the project is started
- a version control system is mandatory
- project files should be stored in more than one place and vigorously synchronized
